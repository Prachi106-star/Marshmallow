THe steps to create marshmallow :

Prepare the pan. Grease well (cooking spray, butter or vegetable shortening) and then cover in powdered sugar.

In the bowl of a stand mixer add 3 1/2 packets of gelatin to 1/2 cup ice cold water. Let stand while you prepare the sugar.

In a pan over medium heat add 2 cups granulated sugar, 1/2 cup corn syrup and 1/2 cup water. Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat to high, allow to boil until the mixture has reached 240 on a candy thermometer.

Turn the mixer on low and slowly pour the hot sugar into the gelatin mixture. Once all the sugar has been added, raise speed to high. Beat on high until light and fluffy and tripled in volume, about 6 minutes.

In a medium bowl, add the egg whites and salt. Beat with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites and vanilla into the marshmallows.

Pour marshmallows into prepared pan. Smooth into an even layer, sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Allow to sit at room temperature until set, about 3 hours. Invert pan on a flat surface, slice into squares.

And then marshmallows prepared !!!!
